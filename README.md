# Melodie: Agent-based Modeling in Python


[![Build](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/Melodie/actions/workflows/wheels.yml/badge.svg?branch=dist)](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/Melodie/actions/workflows/wheels.yml)

**Melodie** is a framework for developing agent-based models (ABMs) in Python.
The package and its examples are maintained on [ABM4ALL](https://github.com/ABM4ALL).
For detailed introduction and tutorial of the package, please visit our documentation page.

The package name **Melodie** comes from an example which poetically explains the core concept of complexity theory: **Emergence**.
In his bold book *Emergent Evolution*, [C. Lloyd Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Lloyd_Morgan) wrote:
*The emergent step, though it may seem more or less saltatory [a leap], is best regarded as a qualitative change of direction,
or critical turning-point, in the course of events.* Then, Morgan exemplified how melody emerges from chords by quoting *Abt Vogler* of
[Robert Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning):

*"And I know not if,*

*save in this,*

*such gift be allowed to man,*

*That out of three sounds he frame,*

*not a fourth sound,*

*but a star."*

Sitting in Karlsruhe, a lovely city in southern Germany,
I take the German translation - ***Melodie*** - as the name of this package.
