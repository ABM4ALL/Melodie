Covid Contagion
===============

what the overall example is about
introduce the core modules of Melodie with a minimum example introduced in detail

how are the next sections structured
most important: explain the designing idea for ABMs embedded in Melodie.
Then, for the other examples, we can simplify the tutorial.

provide the file tree, including all the files listed in toctree below (except summary).

With this example, I will lead you through
* all block modules
* studio (when finishing the simulator and show results) -->
  * visualizer
  * db browser you can also download DB Browser for SQLite

After finishing this tutorial, you can have a look at the first model in the gallery.


model introduction:

* introduce the agent's attributes (states)
* environment can organize the behavior routine
* write the data_collector
* construct them in the model
* setup the scenario and dataframe_loader
* studio: db browser, visualization (plot)
* refine the infection logic: grid and network
* visualization (grid and network)

From this example, you basically saw all the main functions of all the main modules in Melodie.
For further functions, you could have a look at the api references.

Of course this model is very simplified. Welcome to create repo of an updated version.

* moving of different age_group
* sex group
* city map - school, office, shopping mall, etc.
* regulation - mask, vaccine, quarantine

Thanks!
