Melodie: Agent-based Modeling in Python
=======================================

**Melodie** is an open-source Python library for developing agent-based models.
The repositories of Melodie and its example models are maintained on `ABM4ALL <https://github.com/ABM4ALL>`_,
a developing community among agent-based modelers for sharing ideas and resources.

The name **Melodie** comes from a beautiful example which explains the core concept of complexity theory: \"`emergence`\".
In his bold book *Emergent Evolution*, `C. Lloyd Morgan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Lloyd_Morgan>`_ wrote:
\"The emergent step, though it may seem more or less saltatory [a leap], is best regarded as a qualitative change of direction,
or critical turning-point, in the course of events.\" Then, Morgan poetically exemplified how *Melody* emerges from chords
by quoting a verse of Browning:

.. admonition:: *Abt Vogler*, Robert Browning, 1864

    \"And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,
    That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.\"

Sitting in Karlsruhe, a lovely city in southern Germany, I take the German translation - \"Melodie\" - as the name of this library.
