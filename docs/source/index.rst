.. Melodie documentation index

Welcome to Melodie's documentation!
===================================

Melodie is a general framework that can be used to establish agent-based models for specific uses.
The name comes from the most beautiful metaphor I have ever heard explaining \"What is a complexity system?"

Melody is not about single notes, but emerges from the interaction among notes.

\"Melodie" is the German word of \"Melody", because the latter is already taken.
Also, when writing down this paragraph, I am in Karlsruhe, Germany.
Today is Aug. 4th, 2021.

We define an :ref:`Agent-Based Simulation Interface <abs>` and :ref:`Simulation Manager <sim-man>`,
which control which agents interact with the simulation at each step. We support
:ref:`integration <external>` with popular reinforcement learning simulation interfaces, including
:ref:`gym.Env <api_gym_wrapper>` and :ref:`MultiAgentEnv <api_ma_wrapper>`.
