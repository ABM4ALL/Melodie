Melodie: Agent-based Modeling in Python
=======================================

**Melodie** is a general framework for developing agent-based models (ABMs) in Python.
Melodie and its example repositories are maintained on `ABM4ALL <https://github.com/ABM4ALL>`_,
a developing community among agent-based modelers for sharing ideas and resources.

The name **Melodie** comes from a beautiful example which explains the core concept of complexity theory: \"`emergence`\".
In his bold book *Emergent Evolution*, `C. Lloyd Morgan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Lloyd_Morgan>`_ wrote:
\"The emergent step, though it may seem more or less saltatory [a leap], is best regarded as a qualitative change of direction,
or critical turning-point, in the course of events.\"
Then, Morgan poetically exemplified how *Melody* emerges from chords by quoting *Abt Vogler* of
`Robert Browning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning>`_:

| \"And I know not if,
| save in this,
| such gift be allowed to man,
| That out of three sounds he frame,
| not a fourth sound,
| but a star.\"

Sitting in Karlsruhe, a lovely city in southern Germany,
I take the German translation - \"Melodie\" - as the name of this package.

**Suggested reading path**

* First, you might want to start with the **Introduction** section in which you can, first, get a brief idea what agent-based modeling is about; second, get an overview of the modules in Melodie and how they fit together.
* Second, you can continue with the **Tutorial** section, in which you can find a minimum agent-based model developed with Melodie. We hope it is simple enough to follow, and on the other hand, we believe it shows a clear structure and the most important components to develop an ABM with Melodie.
* Third, for your information, we are also working following sections:

  * **Model Gallery**, which provides examples with more modules are used than in the tutorial. You can start developing your own model with the one that is similar to your case.
  * **Advanced Topics**, which provides some advanced techniques in using **Melodie**, e.g., empty project creation, speed improvement, etc.
  * **API Reference**, which provides the help documentation of **Melodie**.

Now, let's start the journey :)
