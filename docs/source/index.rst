Melodie: Agent-based Modeling in Python
=======================================

**Melodie** is a general framework for developing agent-based models (ABMs) in Python.
Melodie and its example repositories are maintained on `ABM4ALL <https://github.com/ABM4ALL>`_,
a developing community among agent-based modelers for sharing ideas and resources.

The package name **Melodie** comes from an example which poetically explains the core concept of complexity theory: \"`emergence`\".
In his bold book *Emergent Evolution*, `C. Lloyd Morgan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Lloyd_Morgan>`_ wrote:
\"The emergent step, though it may seem more or less saltatory [a leap], is best regarded as a qualitative change of direction,
or critical turning-point, in the course of events.\"
Then, Morgan exemplified how *Melody* emerges from chords by quoting *Abt Vogler* of
`Robert Browning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning>`_:

| \"And I know not if,
| save in this,
| such gift be allowed to man,
| That out of three sounds he frame,
| not a fourth sound,
| but a star.\"

Sitting in Karlsruhe, a lovely city in southern Germany,
I take the German translation - \"Melodie\" - as the name of this package.

**Suggested reading path**

* First, you might want to start with the :ref:`Introduction` section in which you can, first, get a brief idea what agent-based modeling is about; second, get an overview of the modules in Melodie and how they fit together.
* Second, you can continue with the :ref:`Tutorial` section, in which you can find a minimum model (`CovidContagion <https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion>`_) developed with Melodie. It is easier to follow but also shows a clear structure and the most important components to develop an ABM with Melodie.
* Third, since the tutorial only provides a minimum model developed with Melodie, in the :ref:`Model Gallery`, we provide more example models to show how other modules can be used.
* Fourth, for more details, you may try reading the :ref:`Advanced Topics` and :ref:`API Reference` sections.

Now, let's start the journey :)
