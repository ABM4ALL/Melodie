"With the configuration file complete, we can utilize the command line "
"interface to train our agents. We simply type ``abmarl train "
"gym_example.py``, where `gym_example.py` is the name of our configuration"
" file. This will launch Abmarl, which will process the file and launch "
"RLlib according to the specified parameters. This particular example "
"should take 1-10 minutes to train, depending on your compute "
"capabilities. You can view the performance in real time in tensorboard "
"with ``tensorboard --logdir ~/abmarl_results``."
