# Introduction to ABM
## Complex System

Let's take a few examples of complex systems:

1. A pool of water, pull out the plug, the water formed whirlpool
2. Flocks of birds, creating complex formations in the sky
3. Financial markets, where traders push stock prices up and down.


The characteristics of the above system is that they are made of a number of agents, but at the macro-level phenomenon (vortex, formation and fluctuation) almost has nothing to do with a single subject, birds, traders (water molecules). In fact, they are actually depends on the number of agents inside the system, and the connection and interaction between the agents.

We call this kind of phenomenon from "micro subject decision-making and interaction" to "macro system dynamics" "emergence", and call the system with emergence phenomenon "complex system".

In order to capture the microscopic agent of the decision-making in complex system and interactive, depicting "emergent" mechanism, based on the agent of the model (the Agent-based model) is different from another set of modeling methods, such as differential equation. In short, ABM provides us four unique Angle of view for everyone: subject interaction, heterogeneity, bounded rationality, learning and evolution.

## The Unique points of view by ABM

### Agent interaction
System modeling by the ABM framework is more flexible and can depict more abundant interaction rules between actors, which may be local, or global, or a combination of the two. 
### Heterogeneity
In the FRAMEWORK of ABM, the heterogeneity between subjects can be considered, including different endowments of subjects and different objective functions of subjects -- the unsolvable dynamic multi-agent game process can be simulated. In addition, the influence of "the existence and degree of heterogeneity" on mechanism operation and the heterogeneous effect of mechanism on heterogeneous subjects can also be discussed. 
### Bounded rationality(including incomplete information) 
Based on the flexibility of describing the behavior of the subject, ABM model provides a more convenient interface for us to introduce conclusions from psychology and behavioral science into the modeling of social economic system.
### Learning and evolution
For the complex social and economic system with "human" as the main body, the learning ability of the main body may also be considered, because it drives the system to show macro dynamics on a larger time scale, so that the "complex system" becomes a "complex adaptive system". The introduction of subject learning behavior is the difficulty of ABM modeling. Whether to consider it or not, how to model and access it, needs to weigh the design according to system characteristics and research objectives. Meanwhile, the combination of ABM with machine learning and artificial intelligence is also full of imagination.
