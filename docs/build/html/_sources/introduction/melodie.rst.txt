=======

Taking an engineering perspective, Melodie tries to decompose any ABM into the modules as below.

core
 - agent: decision-making rules, learning and adaptation rules, micro parameters/variables
 - environment: interaction mechanism, macro parameters/variables
 - data collector
 - scenario
 - model
register (or other name?)
simulator: to manage scenarios and running (empty, only write "register"?)
two other running modes
 - calibrator
 - trainer
supporting modules
 - network
 - grid
 - studio
 - booster
