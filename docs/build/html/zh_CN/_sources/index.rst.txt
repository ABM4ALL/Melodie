.. Melodie documentation index

Welcome to Melodie's documentation!
===================================

*Melodie* is a general framework that can be used to establish agent-based models for specific uses.
This name comes from the most beautiful metaphor I have ever heard about \"Complexity System":
Melody is not about single notes, but emerges from their interaction.

Since \"Melody" is already taken by other projects, here I take its German translation: \"Melodie".
While writing down this paragraph, I am in Karlsruhe, Germany.

This is a test phrase for translation
